{"name":"Word to Markdown","tagline":"Office 365 add-in for converting Word documents to markdown","body":"# Word to Markdown\r\n\r\n> An Office plugin for converting Microsoft Word documents to Markdown\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nWhen markdown content is needed, perhaps for a blogging system that uses Markdown as input (e.g. Ghost) or for writing project documentation that will live on GitHub, BitBucket or similar, the content author may prefer to work with a tool they're more familiar with rather than learning Markdown syntax.\r\n\r\nIf that preferred tool happens to be Microsoft Word, you can use this add-in to convert the Word document to Markdown.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nPreferably, log any support issues or questions using GitHub Issues (https://github.com/TomSeldon/word-to-markdown/issues).\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can email me ([tom@tomseldon.co.uk](mailto:tom@tomseldon.co.uk)) or contact me on Twitter ([@TomSeldon1](https://www.twitter.com/TomSeldon1)).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
