# Word to Markdown

> An Office plugin for converting Microsoft Word documents to Markdown

## Why?

When markdown content is needed, perhaps for a blogging system that uses Markdown as input (e.g. Ghost) or for writing project documentation
that will live on GitHub, BitBucket or similar, the content author may prefer to work with a tool they're more familiar with rather
than learning Markdown syntax.

If that preferred tool happens to be Microsoft Word, you can use this add-in to convert the Word document to Markdown.
